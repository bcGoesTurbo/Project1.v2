## Overall Concept of Application:

To help users decide on what they feel like eating for dinner. We provide different recipe options to chose from and also give nutritional information that benefits the user.

## Motivation:

With our busy lifestyles, sometimes we run out of ideas on what to do for dinner - this where we wanted to help the end user, by providing a resource to help decide.

## Design Process:

- Deciding on the recipe option.
- 4 Options of the preferred choice
- When the user decides on the desired choice, 3 new choices will show up keeping the first choice there.
- Whatever the user decides as their final decision this will show up at the end and links the user to the recipe website and also gives a nutritional table below. 
- The user can decide whether they want to start over or go with their preferred choice.
